Operators present in Lua are :-(Let A=10 , B=20 , s1= “ab” , s2 = “cd”) 
Operator 	Description 										Example 
+ 			Adds two operands 								A + B will give 30 
- 		Subtracts second operand from the first 			A-B will give -10 
* 			Multiply both operands 							A*B will give 200 
/ 		Divide numerator by de-numerator 					B / A will give 2 
% 		Remainder of after an integer division 				B % A will give 0 
^ 		Exponent Operator takes the exponents 				A^2 will give 100 
- 		Unary - operator acts as negation 					-A will give -10 
== 	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not 	(A == B) is not true.

~= 	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. 	(A ~= B) is true. 

< , > 	Compares the two operands and returns true or false 	(A > B) is false 
(A < B) is true. 

>= , <= 	Compares the value of left operand with right operand, if yes then condition becomes true for ‘>=’ and false for ‘<=’ 	(A >= B) is not true and (A <= B) is true. 

"and" 	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true. 	(A and B) is false. 

"or" 	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non zero then condition becomes true. 	(A or B) is true. 

"not" 	Called Logical NOT Operator. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false. 	not(A and B) is false 

.. 	Concatenates two strings. 	s1..s2 will give abcd 

# 	An unary operator that return the length of the a string. 	#"Hello" will return 5
