# Coffeescript is dynamically typed
# It is not required to indicate data type in the variables

# There are 7 data types

# Six primivite data types:
a = 10 # Numeric Type
b = true # Boolean (true or false)
c = "Text" # String
d = null # Null
d = undefined # Undefined
f = Symbol() # Symbol (ECMAScript 6)

# and one composite data type:
person = {firstName:'John', lastName:'Doe', age:'30'}; # Object
