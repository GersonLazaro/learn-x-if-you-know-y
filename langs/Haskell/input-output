-- whole IO example
main = do
    putStrLn "Hello, what's your name?"
    name <- getLine
    putStrLn ("Hey " ++ name ++ ", you rock!")

-- input
getLine     -- read a line from the standard input device
getChar     -- read a character from the standard input device

-- output
putStr      -- write a string to the standard output device
putStrLn    -- the same as putStr, but adds a newline character
