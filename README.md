# Learn X if you Know Y

Where X = Programming language that you want to learn and Y = Programming language that you already know.

Learn X if you know Y is a different way to learn the syntax of a new programming language if you already know another. Just select the language that you wish to learn and the language that you already know. You can now learn with comparative examples about coding different things in each language.

### I want to learn

Just go to [Learn X if you know Y](https://gersonlazaro.com/learn-x-if-you-know-y/index.html), choose the desired languages, and start to learn. It's a piece of cake.
