---

All contributions are welcome. From a small correction of a letter, to adding an entire language. However, to make the process of collaboration easier, we adopt the following simple rules:

---
#### If you want to make corrections

Have we made a mistake in a code displayed on the site? You can inform us immediately by opening an explanatory issue in Spanish or English, or solve it yourself and send us a Pull Request.

#### If you want to add a sample code

You review Java knowing C ++ and you see an example that then does not appear if you check C ++ knowing Javascript. This means that that example is not in Javascript. If this happens to you (with Javascript or with any language), you can program that example and send a Pull Request. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Check the instructions section in **config.json** and search the **name of the example** you want to add (for example, "Hello World").
2. Verify which is the **filename** (In this case it would be "hello-world")
3. In the **langs** folder, find the language in which you are going to program the example, and **create a file with that filename** (without extension). In that file you must place the code of the example with which you are going to collaborate.
4. **OPTIONAL** - If you have not already done so, add your name in the contributors section in about.html.
5. Send a **Pull Request**. *In the title add [LANGUAGE / CODE]* (eg [Javascript / Hello World]). If you are going to add several codes, you can separate them by commas.

#### If you want to add a new language

If you want to add a new language, **add your folder in langs** and follow the **instructions in the previous point**. The *folder name must start in uppercase*. At the moment of sending the Pull Request, clarify in the title that it is a new language.

#### If you have other ideas for this site

Just write them in the issues, all ideas are welcome.

#### If you want to add a non-existent code example

If you think there is an example code that would be interesting to make available in the comparisons, **first point to an issue**. If we consider that it would be positive to include it, we will respond and proceed to the steps indicated previously.

## General rules

- Be Respectful
- If in doubt, ask in a issue
- Do not complicate the code, make it simple
- Comments are valid (and recommended) in the code, as long as they are not exaggerations.
- When passing a code from one language to another, **try to keep similarities (comments on the same sites, same variable names, etc.) as much as possible**. Remember that the site will be shown as a comparison, and the comparisons are more effective if the similarities are noticed.
